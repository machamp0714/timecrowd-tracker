# Code Quality Rules

Lint Rules:
  - See .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc for the lint rules
  - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval
  - If a lint rule needs to be disabled, ask the user first and explain why
  - Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling the lint rule
  - Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason

# Directory Structure

  - All new files should be added to the src/ directory
  - Raycast command should be added to the src/ directory
  - API functions (get, post, patch) should be added to the src/api directory
  - Components should be added to the src/components directory
  - Utility functions should be added to the src/helpers directory
  - Custom hooks should be added to the src/hooks directory

# Tech stack:

- TypeScript v5.4.5
- React v18.3.3
